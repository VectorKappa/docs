- Physicians Foundation Interoperability Fund

>The physicians foundation is reducing barriers to promote physicians’ participation in exchanging healthcare information by working on the EHR (Electronic Health Records) interoperability. A safe platform for health technology exchange is needed to share and compile data between clinical facilities and healthcare professionals.
 The Physicians Foundation Interoperability Fund assists this technology platform by aiding to cover one-time interface expenses for healthcare professionals and their practices across certain states – Georgia, Louisiana, Connecticut, Missouri, South Carolina, and New Jersey. Grant size offered is $500,000 for the health information technology category.

- 2. Practitioner, Patient, and Computer International Symposium

This symposium was conducted to bring together researchers to analyze the impact of EHR on the physician-patient relationship, best practices for inculcating computers in the medical field, and role of humans in device and software design, while ensuring patients’ care.

The grant size is $100,000 and it’s for clinicians, patients, technology designers, medical educators, and government and institutional leaders.

- 3. Louisiana State Medical Society Educational and Research Foundation

Dr. Andrew Schwarz was engaged in researching healthcare professionals and EMR (Electronic Medical Records) adoption in Louisiana. This study will be taken up nationally by the Louisiana State Medical Society Educational and Research Foundation.

The point of analysis would be to detect inhibitors or regional drivers of EMR adoption, differences between adopters and non-adopters, and patterns that lead to MU (Meaningful Use). This research will determine issues for adoption EMR and help to develop educational and targeted EMR technology for physicians to incorporate.

- 4. Medical Society of Virginia Foundation

This project is focused at supporting implementation and adoption of health information technology. The aim is to assure that the Virginia doctors are prepared to gain meaningful use of the certified EHRs. This project also works on developing a system at the state level for effective healthcare data exchange, and the grant offered is $150,000.
