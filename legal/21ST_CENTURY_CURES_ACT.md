Starting on October 6, 2022, the **definition** of electronic health information (EHI) in the 21st Century Cures Act will expand beyond the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Version 1 to **all** electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) that **a patient has the right to access** under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

**Background:** In the HIPAA Privacy Rule, protected health information (PHI) is considered **any** identifiable health information used, maintained, stored, or transmitted by a covered entity.

A **covered entity health care provider** is one that bills an insurance company for services provided to **any** patient. Covered entities include health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. Note: The Information Blocking Rule **also** applies to **some** organizations that are NOT covered entities; however, it is not applicable to all covered entities

Starting on October 6, 2022, instead of being limited to the USCDI Version 1, the definition of EHI will now include **all** information in a Designated Record Set, as defined under HIPAA.

In other words, EHI **will not be limited to the specific data classes listed in the USCDI** and will also consist of **medical and payment records about a patient** and any information of a type that may be used to make decisions about individuals, including patients. For actors covered by the information blocking rules, all ePHI in a Designated Record Set is considered to be EHI and subject to those rules.

**EHI could include:**

-   Medical records and billing records about individuals maintained by or for a covered healthcare provider;
-   Enrollment, payment, claims adjudication, and case or medical management record systems; or
-   Other records that are used, in whole or in part, by or for the covered entity to make decisions about individuals.
