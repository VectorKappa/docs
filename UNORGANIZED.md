A few examples:
* The CARIN Alliance (Creating Access to Realtime Information Now) focuses on consumers’ access to and control of their health information.
* CodeX is addressing the needs of cancer research, such as conducting clinical trials using “real-world data” gathered from EHRs, and matching patients with clinical trials.
* Da Vinci’s efforts focus on interactions between health care providers and health plans: prior authorization, confirming a patient’s health insurance coverage, and accessing information about the price of care.
* Helios, formed in fall 2021, is focusing on public health use cases, including reporting the incidence of diseases such as Covid-19, influenza, and sexually transmitted disease.
